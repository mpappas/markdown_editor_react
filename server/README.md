# JavaScript Backend Coding Test

## Primary goal (~45 minutes)

The backend challenge consists of creating a backend that goes with the markdown-editor frontend you've created.

The main goal is to save the content created in the markdown editor in a database. In order to do so, you'll need three endpoints:

- **Create**: create a new file into your database. Sends back a unique id.
- **Read**: read the content of a file from your database.
- **Update**: update the content of a specific file in your database.

Watch out for the following:

- Make sure you test your endpoints.
- Use any kind of database you think is suited for the job. Make sure you know its strengths and weaknesses.
- Think about scalability.
